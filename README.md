# The Controversy Behind Consumer Data

The purpose of the document is to explain the controversy of consumer data and the impact that it has on both businesses and consumers. The total amount of data being generated, captured, and consumed globally is increasing rapidly.  We will explore the importance of consumer data through two articles with opposing views. 

## Article 1: _How Businesses Are Collecting Data (And What They’re Doing With It)_

The Business New Daily article, [How Businesses Are Collecting Data (And What They’re Doing With It)](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html), discusses the mutualistic benefits (for both business and consumer) that result from collecting consumer data. Increasing technological advancements have created numerous opportunities for businesses to collect data on the consumer. With this surplus of data, a human can't make any causal inferences. Therefore, machine learning algorithms and other artificial intelligence are used to analyze the data in a precise, quick and efficient manner. This allows businesses to become more profitable by improving overall customer experience. 

Businesses collect personal, engagement, behavioral and attitudinal data to create a complete consumer profile. This profile will help businesses analyze consumer behavior to deliver high-precision analytics and gain actionable insights. This can help improve customer experience, marketing strategies, and overall decision-making within an organization. For example, data can allow companies to provide consumers with a personalized experience. 
Targeted promotions offer products that are relevant to their specific needs and interests making it easier to navigate the sea of information. This saves time and money for the consumer. Overall, consumer data is beneficial for both companies and consumers.

## Article 2: _Consumer Data: Increasing Use Poses Risks to Privacy_

The article [Consumer Data: Increasing Use Poses Risks to Privacy](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-106096.pdf) published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, poses a contradictory view to the previous article. This article discusses how consumers are negatively impacted by corporations' collection of consumer data. The growing use of consumer scores created by companies has led to potential privacy and data security risks. 

Businesses collect, use, and sell consumer data for various purposes including marketing, advertising, and research. The collected data can include personal information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, financial information, and transactional data. Businesses sell consumer data to other companies for their commercial benefit. This practice raises privacy concerns, as consumers may not be aware of who is collecting their data and how it is being used. This creates potential privacy and data security risks. These risks include loss of anonymity, lack of consent, and potential for biased outcomes. Due to the rapid pace of technological change and gaps in federal oversight consumers are left unprotected and at risk. Data privacy laws have been created but they are not enough to fully protect the consumer. 

Consumer data is a contemporary issue that requires a stronger framework to ensure that consumers' personal information and privacy rights are protected. There are benefits to companies collecting consumer data, but from the perspective of the consumer, the privacy and security risks outweigh any benefits.
